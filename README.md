## 📅 Progress Log

### ✅ Day 1 – Project Setup
- Created HuntX folder structure.
- Set up `data/`, `pipeline/`, and virtual environment.
- Initialized Git and VSCode workspace.

### ✅ Day 2 – Data Ingestion
- Created `animals.csv` with 10 species, types, rarity.
- Wrote `ingest_data.py` to load raw data and preview it.

### ✅ Day 3 – Synthetic Data Generation
- Generated 1000 synthetic animal entries using Python.
- Included ID, name, species, breed, danger level, rarity.
- Wrote `generate_data.py` to automate the process.

### ✅ Day 4 – Data Transformation
- Cleaned and structured the generated data.
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values.
- Wrote `transform_data.py` for full transformation pipeline.

### ✅ Day 5 – Terrain Creation
- Defined 10 terrain types (e.g., Jungle, Desert, Arctic).
- Created `terrain.csv` with climate, hazards, and rarity.
- Added difficulty levels (1–50) to terrains.

### ✅ Day 6 – Linking Animals to Terrains
- Mapped animals to terrains randomly.
- Integrated terrain and animal datasets.
- Added `terrain_main.csv` to simulate game-world linkages.

## 🚀 Coming Next
- Introduce the **Universal Travel Key** (realm shifting).
- Generate **hunter stats** (XP, health, kills, fame).
- Add **voice assistant** (mother AI tracking vitals).
- Simulate **event logs** and **rare encounters**.

## 🧠 Story Element
The hunter is guided by his AI bike and a voice assistant (based on his mother) through dangerous realms. One day, he discovers a mysterious **Universal Travel Key** that sends him into unknown worlds—opening the gateway for advanced data scenarios and visual storytelling.
